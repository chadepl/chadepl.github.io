Hello World.

Those are the two words that any programmer usually types when getting to know a new program. 
These are the same two words that I will use to start my personal site. 
In Parallel Gradients I plan on writing about what excites me the most. It is also a way for me to clarify my thoughts. Expect to find: math, programming, and science ...

I hope you enjoy it! 

See you around :)
