When getting to know a new programming language, the first thing most developers try to do is to make these two words appear on the screen of the computer. In my case, this small, innocent-looking, program is often all I need to get hooked into a new language, giving me a glimpse of what it might be possible to do with it. To keep the tradition alive, I will start this blog, my personal corner of the internet, with the same two words:

Hello World!

Even though the idea of having a space to write more casually had been in my mind for a long time, I had not done it because of how hard and time consuming I found it to express my thoughts. Despite this, in the past few years, I have put a big effort in trying to improve my writing. This made me realize that it is possible to get better at untangling and writing down one's thoughts. Not only this, I have discovered the incredible sensation that takes place when one is finally able to do so.

Having said this, I am pursuing two main goals by maintaining this blog. On one hand, I want to keep practicing my writing so I can keep getting better at organizing and expressing my thoughts. On the other, I want to keep a log of my thoughts on the topics that interest me. This is not only a good excuse for exploring different concepts in-depth "just because", but will also, hopefully, help me recalling information more easily.

Because of my [broad range of interests](https://www.notion.so/My-Bio-5703274f1d384f1891259293bbb261d5) don't expect the blog to follow a coherent path. Instead, you can expect to find posts about food, productivity, technology, software, math, machine learning, health, visualization, computer graphics, and more.

I believe that my level of excitement while writing this Hello World "program" is a good indication of my commitment to this journey. I hope you're as excited as I am and that you enjoy what is coming. See you around!
