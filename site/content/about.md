Hi, I am Nicolas, and I am a PhD Candidate at the CGV group at TU Delft. My research focuses on the interaction between humans and AI (I know,  a buzzword ðŸ™ƒ) in the medical domain. 

In my free time, I love to cook and learn more about the world. As for the latter, my interests are broad and dynamic. In present times, you can usually find me reading about applied mathematics (including machine learning and related topics), psychology and behavioral economics, biology, health, and productivity (yeah, things like the [Zettelkasten method](https://zettelkasten.de/introduction/), which I am currently trying to implement). If you are curious about my thoughts on these topics, check out my [blog](/post/). 

Finally, I must admit that although I am trying to get better at writing (that's one of the [goals of the blog](/post/hello_world)), it is not my favorite medium for expressing myself. I love visuals and am a fan of everything visualization like data vis, sci vis, and generative art, just to name a few. From time to time, I post my makings in places like [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/parallelgradients/)  and [Observable](https://observablehq.com/@chadepl?tab=notebooks), in case you want to check them out.  

I realize I completely ignored the story behind the name of this website, Parallel Gradients, and its logo. Fear not, I will be covering these in a soon-to-be-released blog post ðŸ˜‰.
